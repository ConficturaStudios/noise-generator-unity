# Noise Generation Tool for Unity
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](LICENSE)

An editor tool for generating procedural noise textures in Unity. The purpose of this resource is to be able to precalculate useful noise functions to save on runtime performance.

## Current Status

This tool is currently in a working state, but feature updates and bug fixes will continue to come out. If any issues are found, please add a new issue directly and I will address it as soon as possible.

## Features

An editor window for creating procedural noise with fractal and layering options is provided. The window can be opened from Window -> Custom -> Noise Generation. Textures generated by this tool can be writen out to a file as a PNG or saved into a Unity asset. Textures that are output from this tool are saved in an Output folder in the project root directory. Currently, the following noise types are supported:

- 2D Perlin
- 2D Cellular/Worley
- 2D Simplex
- 3D Perlin
- 3D Cellular/Worley
- 3D Simplex

All of the above noise types support seemless tiling and can be seeded for repeatable and customizable results. Each layer has the option to generate the noise as a fractal, with full control over the number of octaves. The amplitude and frequency applied to each octave can be set for the base level, and is multiplied by the gain and lacunarity respectively on each consecutive octave. Generated noise can also be inverted on a layer-by-layer basis. The range for the generated noise is also modifiable, but the results will clamp to a 0 to 1 range after the layer has been calculated.

The color channels affected by each layer can be modified, along with the compositing mode for the individual layer. The following compositing modes are available:

- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide
- Min
- Max

Visibility is togglable for each layer. Layer 0 is the first layer in the stack, with subsequent layers compositing over it. The base image with no layers is black with full alpha. Basic layer operations have also been made available, with the ability to move, duplicate, copy, paste, insert, and delete layers. If a layer with solid color is desired, select None when choose the layer type.

3D textures are stored in an atlas with each element representing one slicing in the z direction. The number of slices are based on the resolution of the texture. The tiling of the atlas can be seen near the top of the window with the label "Volume Texture X/Y Tiles:" if the texture is set to be 3D.

### Planned Features

The following are features that have not yet been implemented, but are on the roadmap:

- Additional compositing modes:
    - Average
    - Power
    - Root
    - Difference

- Opacity controls for each layer
- The option to save and load a layer layout and layer data
- An improved preview viewport
- Performance improvements when generating 3D textures
- File type selection for texture outputs

## Requirements

This tool has been developed using Unity 2019.1.8f1 and utilizes the new Mathematics package available from Unity. The new Unity Job System has also been utilized to improve build times when generating and updating textures.
